Notes on my solution to the code test
=====================================

* As it stands the game has a basic Board class to which tokens can be added, and which checks for valid moves

* Next steps would be for the game controller Game to set up a game, keep track of the user choice of token, and include error handling so that invalid moves can be reported back to the user

* Next step would be to add the text mode interface that creates a new game based on user input

* The Board class should have a #display method which prints the board as a board (instead of as a vector) to present to the user
